Model Description
    Model as graph search where each node is a system configuration

Procedure
    Choose initial node as start of search (based on constraints)
    Explore neighbor neighbors at random
    Choose best performing neighbor as new starting point


system_config
    "cpu_count": "1",
    "cpu_frequency": "3000000000",
    "cache_size": "16777216"



# Choose initial system configuration based on constraints

# Visit neighboring nodes based on constraints


F(stats(system_configuration(constraints)), constraints)
